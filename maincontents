## MY DEVELOPER BACKGROUND

<p> 
Hello I am Josh, I use the name Lunavia online as my developer name! I'm 18, turning 19 in like a couple weeks (October 4th) and I studied Sociology, English Literature and Computer Science at A Level.
</p>
<p>
Currently I am a part time developer for my own indie games studio INNERMINDS founded by myself and two of my closest friends back in Year 12 of Sixth Form.

<p>
Currently I am working on a game called WITHIN TIME, a turn based JRPG taking inspirations from the classics like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest and the Persona Series.

The game uses the **GAME MAKER STUDIO 2** engine, same engine that Undertale was developed in. I am entirely self taught when it comes to programming, using documentation provided by GMS and a few youtube tutorials.

The game is expected to be released in the coming years, with a team of 12 working on the game currently including myself.

## OTHER SKILLS

<p>
I am also an artist, having been practicing since I was about 13 and recently picking up the ability to do pixel art in order to be the lead artist on my game's team! I'm very passionate about my own work and also ensuring that my game is a success!

Here's a few examples of that:
