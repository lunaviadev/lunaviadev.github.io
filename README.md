# A BIT ABOUT ME!

## HOBBIES

<p> 
Hello I am Josh, I use the name Lunavia online as my developer name! I'm 18, turning 19 in like a couple weeks (October 4th) and I studied Sociology, English Literature and Computer Science at A Level.
</p>
<p>
Currently I am a part time developer for my own indie games studio INNERMINDS founded by myself and two of my closest friends back in Year 12 of Sixth Form.
